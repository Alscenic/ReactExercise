## Some notes
- Full disclosure, I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get up and running quickly,
  but I used it almost exclusively for the npm packages and startup scripts so I didn't have to fiddle with them myself.
  Nearly every line of code and source file has been changed, replaced, or removed.
- I really like the structure that TypeScript classes provide and heavily prefer object-oriented to data-oriented (as you
  can probably tell.) As much as I would like to use the seemingly preferred functional components, if I'm being honest,
  I just can't wrap my head around them right now. I understand the workflow, but I'm going to need some practice.

This was a fun little exercise, and I definitely needed it as I've been falling out of practice with
programming in general. I usually spend my time in Unity programming the full stack in C# and HLSL
because it gives me that immediate visual feedback that my brain loves
