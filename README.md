## Notes
- Full disclosure, I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get up and running quickly,
  but I used it almost exclusively for the npm packages and startup scripts so I didn't have to fiddle with them myself.
  Nearly every line of code and source file has been changed, replaced, or removed.
